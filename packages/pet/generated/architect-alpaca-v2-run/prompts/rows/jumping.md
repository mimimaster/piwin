Create one horizontal animation strip for Codex pet `architect-alpaca`, state `jumping`.

Use the attached canonical base for identity. Use the attached layout guide only for slot count, spacing, centering, and padding; do not draw the guide.

Output exactly 5 full-body frames in one left-to-right row on flat pure cyan #00FFFF. Treat the row as 5 invisible equal-width slots: one centered complete pose per slot, evenly spaced, with no overlap, clipping, empty slots, labels, or borders.

Identity: same pet in every frame: Cute cream-white alpaca coding companion with oversized round black glasses, a deep navy hoodie, and a small closed graphite tablet as its signature prop. It represents an engineer who cares about architecture, contracts, private host-first tooling, strict TypeScript, and calm iterative craftsmanship. Personality: thoughtful, precise, patient, quietly playful, and dependable. Keep the design simple enough for 192x208 pet cells.. Preserve silhouette, face, proportions, markings, palette, material, style, and props.
Style: Pet-safe sprite: compact full-body mascot, readable in a 192x208 cell, clear silhouette, simple face, stable palette/materials, and crisp edges for chroma-key extraction. Style `3d-toy`: Stylized 3D toy mascot with smooth rounded forms, simple materials, clear silhouette, and no photoreal complexity. User style notes: Polished soft 3D collectible-toy render, deep navy and cobalt accents, warm cream fur, subtle cool rim light on the pet only, compact whole-body silhouette, no readable marks or text..
Animation continuity: keep apparent pet scale and baseline stable within the row unless the state itself intentionally changes vertical position, such as `jumping`. Move the pose within the slot instead of redrawing the pet larger or smaller frame to frame.

State action: Hover jump loop: anticipation, lift, airborne peak, descent, and settle through body height.

State requirements:
- Show the jump through pose and vertical body position only: anticipation, lift, airborne peak, descent, settle.
- Do not draw ground shadows, contact shadows, drop shadows, oval shadows, landing marks, dust, smears, bounce pads, or motion marks under the pet.
- Keep the background outside the pet perfectly flat chroma key with no darker key-colored patches.

Clean extraction: crisp opaque edges, safe padding, no scenery, text, guide marks, checkerboard, shadows, glows, motion blur, speed lines, dust, detached effects, stray pixels, or chroma-key colors inside the pet.
